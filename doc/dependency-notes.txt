If this project is depended-on transitively, it will pull in
xmlParserAPIs by virtue of batik-ext, and serializer by virtue of xalan.
Nothing I have tried eliminates these unnecessary dependencies on this side.
Users will have to use their dependency product's transitive exclusion
mechanism (which I find are very limited and generally do not work) or live
with the extra libraries.
